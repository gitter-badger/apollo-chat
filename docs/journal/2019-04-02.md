## Basic API is ready

You can try it out in GraphQLs playground. Link will be printed in console when running
dev server.

App needs you to be authenticated. It uses [mLab](https://mlab.com/) and [Redis](https://redislabs.com/) to store data. You need to have DBs there and provide credentials through [.env](/.env.example) file.

Query examples are listed [here](/docs/api/queries.md).

It still doesn't have messages api tho :)
